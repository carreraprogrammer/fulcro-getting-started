  # 📖 [FULCRO GETTING STARTED] <a name="about-project"></a>


**[FULCRO GETTING STARTED]**  contains the code and resources for executing all the lessons of the Fulcro videos. The videos cover various topics related to building web applications using the Fulcro framework, including Pathom, Datomic, and other related tools.

The repository is organized into multiple branches, each corresponding to a specific lesson or set of related lessons. Each branch contains the code and resources necessary to complete the lesson, as well as any notes or documentation associated with the lesson.

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

The following technologies were used in the development of this project:

Ruby: To create and manipulate the classes


### Key Points <a name="key-features"></a>

- **How Fulcro normalizes data. Pay particular attention to query, ident, and initial state. These are the core of Fulcro’s operation.**
- **The core internals of I/O operation are still mutations (which in turn are used to implement the internals of loads); however, application authors would do well to pay attention to UI State Machines, which are generally a better way to organize groups of operations around components in order to reason over them.**
- **Consider Fulcro RAD early in your application development. The attribute-centric focus brings a lot of extensibility/flexibility to your application, and the overall design and internals might help you understand more advanced usage of Fulcro itself.**
- **Data storage with Datomic: The application uses Datomic as the database to store the todo items, ensuring data persistence and reliability.**
- **Querying with Datalog: The application uses Datalog to query the database and retrieve the todo items for display in the table.**
- **Consider Fulcro RAD early in your application development. The attribute-centric focus brings a lot of extensibility/flexibility to your application, and the overall design and internals might help you understand more advanced usage of Fulcro itself.**
- **Understand the GraphQL query language and its syntax, and the basics of how Pathom generates a runtime for executing GraphQL queries. You should also be familiar with Pathom resolvers and how to define a schema using Clojure data structures.**
- **Understand the basics of Datomic, a database that provides a flexible, distributed data storage and querying system. You should be familiar with Datomic's unique concepts such as datalog and the peer-server architecture..**
